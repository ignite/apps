# **Ignite App Registry**

## **Overview**

The Ignite App Registry is a directory designed to catalog applications built within the Ignite Apps ecosystem. It aims to facilitate discovery, collaboration, and information sharing among developers and users. By submitting your app to the registry, you make it easier for the community to learn about and engage with your project.

## **How to Add Your Ignite App**

To add your app to the Ignite App Registry, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the `ignite/apps` repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Set Up Your App Directory**: Inside the repository and inside the directory `_ignite_app_registry`, create a new directory named after your app. Ensure the name is unique and descriptive.
3. **Configure Your App**: In your app's directory, add an `app.json` file. This file should contain all the relevant details about your app according to the template provided below.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you've added your app's directory and `app.json` file, submit a pull request to the original `ignite/apps` repository. Your pull request will be reviewed by the  maintainers, and once approved, your app will be listed in the registry.

## `app.json` File Structure**

Below is the template for the `app.json` file. Replace each placeholder with the specific details of your app.

- **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide clear and concise descriptions of your app's features and functionality.
