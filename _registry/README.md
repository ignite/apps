# Ignite App Registry

## Overview

The Ignite App Registry is a directory designed to catalog applications built within the Ignite Apps ecosystem. It aims to facilitate discovery, collaboration, and information sharing among developers and users. By submitting your app to the registry, you make it easier for the community to learn about and engage with your project.

## How to Add Your Ignite App

To add your app to the Ignite App Registry, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the `ignite/apps` repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Set Up Your App Directory**: Within the `_registry` directory of the repository, create a JSON file named using the following format: `username.repository.app_name.json`. Use your GitHub username, repository name, and app name to complete the filename.
3. **Configure Your App**: Populate the previously created file with all the necessary details about your app, following the template provided below.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once the above steps are completed, submit a pull request to the original `ignite/apps` repository. Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers, and once approved, your app will be listed in the registry.
