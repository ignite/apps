A request is mechanism in Ignite that allows changes to be made to the genesis
file like adding accounts with token balances and validators. Anyone can submit
a request, but only the coordinator of a chain can approve or reject a request.

Each request has a status:

* Pending: waiting for the approval of the coordinator
* Approved: approved by the coordinator, its content has been applied to the
  launch information
* Rejected: rejected by the coordinator or the request creator
